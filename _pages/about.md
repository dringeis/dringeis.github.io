Born in France, I studied for my Bachelor and Master of Science in Switzerland, and I was awarded my PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in Northern Germany at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research, and the University of Bremen. After my first PostDoc at McGill University, I went on to do a postdoc at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City through a collaboration with Columbia University.

My research interests include:
• High-resolution sea ice modeling: As we increased the resolution of the climate models, we now have the power to resolve more features in the sea ice cover, like leads (fracture lines) and large ice floes. The question is now to know if what we are modeling is correct compared to the observations.
• Long-term sea level rise prediction: During my postdoc at NASA, I focused on the coupling between the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) and the NASA climate model modelE. In the last year, I tackled the snow and firn modeling on ice sheets, at the interface of atmosphere and ice, to ensure an accurate mass and energy exchange between the two models.

I am excited to start my new position at ECCC in Victoria, at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) on sea ice modeling for climate applications, where I think my expertise in dynamic and thermodynamics of sea ice and snow/firn/land ice will be useful.

### #SciComm

I'm interested in sharing knowledge with the public about climate change and the impact of human activities on the polar region.

### Personal life

My personal interests are going from international politics, scoutism, science fiction books and movies, ecology and environmental protection, radio and podcasting, and photography (film and digital).
