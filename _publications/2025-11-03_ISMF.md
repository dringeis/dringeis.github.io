### Abstract:

Ice sheet mass loss is typically provided for grounded ice, because changes
in floating ice are more difficult to measure and contribute minimally to sea
level rise. However, net freshwater mass flow rate across ice sheet boundaries,
including floating ice, is a better metric of ice sheet health. 
Here we present total mass flows across ice sheet boundaries for both the
Greenlandic and Antarctic ice sheets and their peripheral glaciers from 2010
through 2019. In addition to total mass flow, we provide constituent terms and
gross rather than net values, including components that combine to provide
surface mass balance (SMB).
Ice mass loss in Greenland is 330 +-50 Gt yr-1 which is ~30 % larger than
the 255 +-40 Gt yr-1 grounded ice mass loss estimates that neglect floating
ice changes. Ice mass loss in Antarctica is 450 +-270 Gt yr-1 which is ~2.4x
the 190 +-115 Gt yr-1 grounded ice mass loss estimates. Freshwater mass flow
rate from Greenland is ~1065 +-120 Gt yr-1 or ~3x mass loss (~4x grounded
mass loss), and from Antarctica is ~3110 +-1515 Gt yr-1, or ~7x mass loss (~16x
grounded mass loss).
